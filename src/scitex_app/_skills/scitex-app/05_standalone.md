  [TOPIC] Standalone Mode
  [DETAILS] run_standalone() — launch a SciTeX app locally with the full workspace shell (Django + sidebar + file tree + AI panel) without scitex-hub..
tags: [scitex-app-standalone]

# Standalone Mode

`scitex_app.embed.run_standalone()` launches any SciTeX app locally with the full workspace shell — same UX as scitex-hub, no server required.

`embed` is the public host-embedding surface (`scitex_app.embed`) — import from there, not from the private `scitex_app._standalone` / `scitex_app._django` implementation modules.

## run_standalone()

```python
def run_standalone(
    app_module: str,
    port: int = 8050,
    host: str = "127.0.0.1",
    open_browser: bool = True,
    hot_reload: bool = False,
    working_dir: Optional[str] = None,
    desktop: bool = False,
    extra_installed_apps: Optional[list[str]] = None,
    extra_staticfiles_dirs: Optional[list[str]] = None,
    extra_env: Optional[dict[str, str]] = None,
) -> None
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `app_module` | required | Dotted path to the app's Django module (e.g. `"my_app"`) |
| `port` | `8050` | TCP port for the Django server |
| `host` | `"127.0.0.1"` | Host to bind (use `"0.0.0.0"` for LAN access) |
| `open_browser` | `True` | Open browser tab automatically after 1.5 s |
| `hot_reload` | `False` | Enable Django `--reload` (file watching) |
| `working_dir` | `None` | Sets `SCITEX_WORKING_DIR`; defaults to `cwd` |
| `desktop` | `False` | Launch as native window via `pywebview` if installed |
| `extra_installed_apps` | `None` | Additional Django app strings to add to `INSTALLED_APPS` |
| `extra_staticfiles_dirs` | `None` | Additional static file directories |
| `extra_env` | `None` | Extra env vars to set before Django configures |

### Basic usage

```python
from scitex_app.embed import run_standalone

# Minimal — app at my_app/urls.py, my_app/views.py, etc.
run_standalone(app_module="my_app")

# Custom port, no browser
run_standalone(app_module="my_app", port=8051, open_browser=False)

# Native desktop window (requires: pip install pywebview)
run_standalone(app_module="my_app", desktop=True)
```

### From a scaffolded app's CLI

Apps created with `scitex-app app init` get a `_cli.py` with a `gui` command:

```bash
my-app gui                           # default port 8050
my-app gui --port 8051 --no-browser
my-app gui --force                   # stop THIS app's own previous instance, then serve
```

The `gui` command uses `scitex_app.embed.serve_gui`: it binds exactly
`--port` or fails loud (never drifts to the next free port), and refuses
a second instance of this app's own GUI unless `--force` is given.

`--force` stops this app's own GUI whether it is *recorded* in the
runtime state or *orphaned* — still holding the port after dying without
clearing that state, which is exactly the case the flag exists for.
It never touches a process it cannot prove is ours, and ownership is
proven from the holder's **argv**, not its name: a `comm` of `python`
is shared by every Python server on the box.

For a foreign holder it prints the name, pid and argv with a `kill`
command, and never offers `--force` — a remedy that would refuse.
When the port is held but the holder cannot be identified (our agent
containers deny `/proc/<pid>/fd` even for our own processes), it says
so plainly rather than blaming another user. The three outcomes are
declared on `PortHolder.status`: `free`, `identified`, `unreadable`;
`ours` is three-valued — `True`, `False`, or `None` for "we could not
look".

### Django settings configured

**ONLY IF DJANGO IS NOT ALREADY CONFIGURED.** `_configure_django()` opens with
`if django.conf.settings.configured: return`, so if your app sets
`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` and calls `django.setup()` before `run_standalone()`,
**none of the settings below apply to you** — your own settings module supplies
all of them, and the SDK contributes nothing.

That is the shape every embedded leaf uses today, so for those apps this list is
not what you get. Measured 2026-08-23 with scitex-scholar: their `_server.py`
calls `django.setup()` and then `run_standalone()`, and the running process
reports their own `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, not the SDK's. I had assumed the opposite and
told them so; the one-line check below is what settled it.

```python
import django.conf
print(django.conf.settings.configured)      # True before run_standalone -> SDK is inert
print(django.conf.settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS)   # whose list did you actually get?
```

If Django is unconfigured at call time, `run_standalone()` calls
`django.conf.settings.configure()` with:

- `INSTALLED_APPS`: `django.contrib.staticfiles`, `<app_module>`, `scitex_ui` (if installed)
- `ROOT_URLCONF`: `<app_module>.urls`
- `STATIC_URL`: `/static/`
- `STATICFILES_DIRS`: app's own `static/` + `_standalone_static/` shell assets
- `DATABASES`: `{}` (no DB required for read-only apps)
- `SECRET_KEY`: from `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` env or `"scitex-standalone-dev-key"`
- `DEBUG`: from `DJANGO_DEBUG` env (default `"true"`)

- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: loopback, the bound `host`, and `SCITEX_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (comma-separated)

Settings configure only once. Note this cuts two ways, and the second is the one
that surprises people: calling `run_standalone()` twice is a harmless no-op, but
configuring Django *yourself* first makes the SDK's settings silently inert —
no error, no warning, and a `serve --host` that binds fine and then 400s if your
own `ALLOWED_HOSTS` does not include the address.

### Chat, in a profile with no database

`DATABASES: {}` above is not a detail — it decides which chat routes you may
mount. There are two mount points and they are not interchangeable:

```python
urlpatterns += chat.chat_stream_urlpatterns   # streaming only, NO database
urlpatterns += chat.chat_urlpatterns          # + session history, needs one
```

`chat_urlpatterns` bundles the session CRUD routes and every one of those
queries the ORM, so mounting it here is a 500 per request, not a degraded mode.
Until 0.21.0 it was the only list published — a trap with no correct exit.
`chat_stream_urlpatterns` is the exit, and it is the one this profile wants.

Session history needs BOTH a database AND the models' app registered. Those two
requirements come apart (a host can have one without the other), so since 0.22.0
the views name which one is missing. Catch `chat.ChatSessionsUnavailableError`
for "can these work here at all"; its two subclasses say which fix applies.

### Requirements

- `django` (always required)
- `scitex_ui` (optional, provides the workspace shell sidebar/panel)
- `pywebview` (optional, only for `desktop=True`)

### Testing the `gui` command's real CLI path

`serve_gui`'s state-file location can be redirected with an env var --
the only channel available to a subprocess-driven end-to-end test
(`python -m my_app gui serve` run as a real subprocess), which cannot
inject a path via function arguments across a process boundary. Set
`SCITEX_<PACKAGE>_GUI_STATE` (package name uppercased, non-alnum chars
-> `_`, e.g. `SCITEX_MY_APP_GUI_STATE` for `"my-app"`) before spawning
the subprocess to point state at a tmp path instead of the developer's
real runtime state -- keeps end-to-end CLI tests mock-free.
