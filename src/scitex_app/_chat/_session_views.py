"""Django views for chat session CRUD.

Ported from scitex-cloud's llm_app/views/sessions.py.
All endpoints are CSRF-exempt for programmatic API use.

EVERY VIEW HERE QUERIES THE ORM, so a host mounting them must configure a
database. `chat_stream_view` in `_django.py` does not and is safe without
one. ("standalone" is reserved for the launcher — see `_models.py`.)

Endpoints:
    GET    /api/chat/sessions/                  — list sessions
    POST   /api/chat/sessions/                  — create session
    GET    /api/chat/sessions/<id>/              — get session detail
    PATCH  /api/chat/sessions/<id>/              — update session title
    DELETE /api/chat/sessions/<id>/              — delete session
    GET    /api/chat/sessions/<id>/messages/     — get session messages
    POST   /api/chat/sessions/<id>/messages/     — add message to session

    subclasses exist because the two FIXES are different, and an error that

    Django's own reads "settings.DATABASES is improperly configured. Please

    and reads as simply wrong to a host that left DATABASES empty deliberately.
    The host's error is not the setting; it is having mounted these views at
    all.

    HONEST ABOUT WHAT THIS IS. It is a better DIAGNOSIS, not a barrier.
    Mounting `chat_urlpatterns` without a database still imports, still starts,
    and still fails per request. Making it impossible rather than merely loud
    is a separate question about whether these views belong in this SDK — see

    Django creates the classes happily and only consults the app registry
    later, at query time. A host with a real database and no registration
