# This module used to declare its own five-key set against the CLI's six, so

# table in the skills shipped for weeks comparing them check-by-check without
# saying so. Same defect as the JS pattern list fixed in 0.16.2, same remedy.

# THE PUBLIC SURFACE, DECLARED RATHER THAN INHERITED FROM MODULE LAYOUT.
#
# Without this, `scitex_app.validator.X` reached ten names nobody meant to
# publish — json, logging, re, Path, List, Optional, dataclass, field, logger.
# Anything importable is a promise somebody can depend on, and a promise made by
# accident is still a promise.
#
# The reason it matters HERE specifically is scitex-writer's, 2026-09-06. They
# asked whether the "one pattern list" guarantee was checkable from outside, and
# their answer was: do NOT publish the identity. `a is b` is the right INTERNAL
# test — it is what stops a re-declaration going green — but making it checkable
# from outside means exporting both sides, and the canonical side lives two
# underscore modules deep. Publishing a private path to prove a property about
# the mechanism makes the private path load-bearing, and then it is not private.
#
# What a consumer can use instead is SINGULARITY OF THE PUBLIC NAME: there is
# exactly one public route to each shared object, so there is nothing for their
# code to disagree with. That was already TRUE before this block, and true only
# BY ACCIDENT OF LAYOUT. Declaring `__all__` turns it into a property a test can
# assert — see tests asserting exactly one public path reaches each.

# This list used to be nine patterns here and five in `_validate/_js.py`, and

# landed in one implementation only. Four of the original nine —
# `__import__`, `os.system`, `subprocess`, `exec\s*\(` — are the PYTHON
# forbidden list copy-pasted into a JS scanner, and they were removed there

#
# `RegExp.prototype.exec` in a tokenizer loop. Not code execution, and
# `\bexec\s*\(` cannot tell a member call from the eval-family builtin.
#
# They reported it rather than renaming the variable to dodge the checker,
# which is why it is fixed here instead of hidden in their tree.
#
# The import is the point. Syncing two lists is a promise; importing one is a
